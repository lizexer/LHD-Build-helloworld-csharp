# LHD-Build-helloworld-csharp
I created this Hello World program using C# as part of MLH's LHD: Build hackathon. The challenge was to write a hello world program in a new language, and I followed along with Aditya from MLH as he taught participants an intro to C# and .NET applications.
This is also my first repository and utilization of GitHub.
